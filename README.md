# Project #5. Decentralized Star Notary

This is Project 5, in this project I created the my first DAPP (Star Notary) and I was able to publish it to Rinkeby network. I used OpenZeppelin for ERC-721 implementations. Truffle framework has been used heavily in this project too. I used Mocha and Chai for unit testing.

## Setup project for Review.

1. Download or clone the project.
2. Open using VS code.
3. Make sure you have Truffle installed in your machine, 
4. Run Truffle Develop CLI, then compile, migrate, and test there.
